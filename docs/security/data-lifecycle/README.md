# Data Lifecycle + LGPD — ExchangeOS

> Per-table retention schedule, archival policy, right-to-erasure workflow, and
> data classification matrix. Required for LGPD (Lei 13.709/2018) compliance +
> ISO 27001 controls 8.10 (information deletion), 8.11 (data masking), 8.12
> (data leakage prevention).

## Data classification matrix

| Class | Definition | Examples in ExchangeOS | Encryption | Retention default |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **C1 — Public** | No risk if disclosed | currency codes, calendars (refdata) | TLS in transit only | Indefinite |
| **C2 — Internal** | Operational; minor harm | trade IDs, BIC codes, system events | TLS + at-rest GCP default | 7 years |
| **C3 — Confidential** | Commercial harm if leaked | trade prices, NOP, P&L, BACEN report payloads | TLS 1.3 + CMEK HSM | 7 years (regulatory) |
| **C4 — Restricted (PII)** | LGPD-regulated; legal harm | counterparty actor names, beneficial owner data, screening matches | TLS 1.3 + CMEK HSM + per-field column encryption (planned) | 5 years post-relationship; right-to-erasure on request |

LGPD legal basis used per dataset is recorded in this table — most ExchangeOS
data falls under "execução de contrato" (Art. 7º V) or "obrigação legal"
(Art. 7º II, BACEN/COAF reports).

| `ssis` | C4 | Contract | 7 years post-deactivation | T+1y | Anonymise account number + IBAN |

| `outbox_events` + `_archive` | C3 | Audit | 90 days hot / 7 years cold | T+90d | NEVER (audit) |

## Archival cron (planned)

`cmd/archiver/main.go` — nightly job (02:00 SP) that:

1. For each table with archival rule, selects rows older than the threshold
2. Bulk-exports to GCS `gs://exchangeos-archive-<env>/<table>/YYYY/MM/DD/<batch>.parquet.gz`
3. Computes SHA256 + writes to manifest table `archive_manifest`
4. Marks rows as archived (sets `archived_at`)
5. After 30 days of `archived_at`, hard-deletes from CRDB (if not under legal hold)
6. Emits `archival.completed.v1` to outbox for audit

GCS bucket lifecycle: Coldline → Archive after 1 year → permanent retention
(regulated tables) or deletion (LGPD-eligible tables).

## Right-to-erasure workflow (LGPD Art. 18 IV)

```
DPO receives request → routes via secure channel
   ↓
Verify identity (CPF + 2FA via Identos)
   ↓
Classification:
   ├─ If under regulatory hold (BACEN 5y / 10y) → REJECT with citation, notify ANPD
   ├─ If overlapping legal basis (KYC active) → DEFER until basis expires
   └─ If erasable → proceed
        ↓
   Execute via cmd/erasure-worker:
     - UPDATE actor SET name='[REDACTED]', tax_id='[REDACTED]', email='[REDACTED]', ...
     - DELETE from quote_streams WHERE requester_id=...
     - UPDATE counterparties SET name='[REDACTED]', beneficial_owner='[REDACTED]' WHERE id IN ...
     - Audit-log every change with audit_event(type='LGPD_ERASURE', subject_id=...)
        ↓
   Notify subject within 15 days (Art. 19 LGPD)
        ↓
   Update DPO log
```

Workflow code: `cmd/erasure-worker/` (not yet implemented; tracked as future
work in `.base/plans/00-governance/lgpd-backlog.md`).

## Data Protection Officer (DPO) responsibilities

- Single point of contact for ANPD (Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados)
- Maintains the data inventory (this document)
- Quarterly review of retention vs. actual archival/deletion
- Tracks erasure requests in `.audit-bundles/lgpd-requests/YYYY/`
- Annual DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) for any new field collecting PII

## Operational checklist

| Activity | Frequency | Owner | Evidence |
|----------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Archival job ran successfully | Daily | Platform on-call | Grafana panel `archive_jobs_completed_total` |
| Retention review (table-by-table) | Quarterly | DPO + Compliance | `.audit-bundles/lgpd-reviews/YYYY-Qn.md` |
| Right-to-erasure requests SLA (15 days) | Per-request | DPO | `.audit-bundles/lgpd-requests/` |
| DPIA for new PII fields | Per-field | DPO | `.audit-bundles/dpia/YYYY-MM-<field>.md` |
| Restore-from-archive drill | Annual | Platform + DPO | Drill writeup |
