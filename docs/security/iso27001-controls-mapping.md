# ISO 27001:2022 Annex A — Controls Mapping for ExchangeOS

> 93 controls across 4 themes (Organizational / People / Physical / Technological).
> Each row maps the control to ExchangeOS evidence: file paths, release versions,
> deferred items, and the responsible owner.

Owner: Security team
Scope: ExchangeOS module + its hosting (GKE Autopilot / GCP / shared CRDB hub).

## Legend

- ✅ Implemented and evidenced
- 🟡 Partial — implementation exists but evidence file is incomplete
- ⏳ Deferred — tracked separately (cert engagement Sprint 16)
- N/A — control not applicable to ExchangeOS scope
